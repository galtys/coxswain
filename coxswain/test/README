The test suite attempts to compile all of the *.l?hs files it finds in
test/{ill,well}-typed/. Or, if given arguments, it will interpret each
as the path to a test file.

There are these kinds of test result: Bad, Expected, Unexpected.

  Bad is if the file doesn't exist under test/{ill,well}-typed, its
  dependencies don't compile, etc. Notably it's also requires that the
  file name be T<N>.hs where N is a non-negative number with no
  leading 0s. (This is to encourage test authors to write comments in
  the test file itself -- a terse filename is never sufficient!)

  Expected is if it's not Bad and its compilation result does match
  the directory prefix.

  Unexpected is if it's not Bad and its compilation result does not
  match the directory prefix.

Any test file will be able to import modules from any aux/ directory
that's a sibling of it or any of its ancestors up to but excluding
test/.
